# Spring MVC - A Java Framework

### This repository is the output of my learning/practicing. I had followed a tutorial series. For one or two tutorials I made a project in Spring MVC.


Are you a fresher? Then you may face a lots of problem if you try to run these spring mvc projects. So it's better to start spring boot.
